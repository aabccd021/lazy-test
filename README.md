# pure-test

- parallel by default
- parallel tests can be coverted to sequential
- sequential tests can not be converted to parallel tests

# When to use test group
Use test group when a group of tests:
- do not want to be splitted by sharding
- needs to be run sequentially
- should pass altogether or should fail altogether
